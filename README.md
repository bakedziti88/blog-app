# Blog Style Web Application - Frontend

The frontend, for a MERN stack SPA. Will be deployed within 5-7 days, the frontend still needs to be styled and some smaller functionality needs to be fixed/added in (June 12 2020)

## Motivation

Learning React forced me to think in a very different way than what I was used to. While I was learning, I only produced small scripts/fragments of actual applications. I realized to that in order to further my understanding of this library, I needed to create a much larger application, which would also showcase what I was currently capable of creating with this new knowledge.
